## Node Fast Template

Introducing the **Node Fast Template** - A solution to quickly set up a basic Node.js Express server with all the necessary configurations to get started with your business logic!

### Why the template is fast?
1. `compression` middleware:
    - Reduced bandwidth usage and faster data transmission.
    - Improved performance and faster download times.
    - Browser compatibility with gzip and deflate.
2. `clusters` middleware:
    - Efficient utilization of multi-core processors for parallel processing.
    - Improved server availability and reliability with automatic worker restarts.
    - Load balancing for better scalability and handling of incoming requests.
    - Horizontal scaling capability for increased system capacity.

### Why the template is secure?
1. `helmet` middleware:
    - Sets security-related HTTP headers automatically, mitigating common web vulnerabilities.
    - Protects against XSS attacks, clickjacking, and MIME type sniffing vulnerabilities.
    - Guards against CSRF attacks using CSRF tokens.
2. `autocannon` test:
    - Simple command-line interface for load testing HTTP/HTTPS servers.
    - Customizable scenarios and configurations for flexible testing.
    - Supports concurrent connections and parallel requests for realistic simulation.

  ### Why the template is fit for developers?
  1. Pre configured `env`, `cors`, and `body-parser`.
  2. `morgan` middleware:
      - Logs HTTP request details like method, URL, status code.
      - Provides insights into server performance and traffic patterns.
      - Aids in debugging and troubleshooting with request and response information.
  3. Folder structure follow `MVC` pattern.
